# Swift Beginner Workshop –– [try!Swift Bangalore 2017](https://www.tryswift.co/events/2017/bangalore/)

## Objective
The workshop is designed for software developers with prior experience in languages such as `Java`, `Objective-C`, and `Javascript`. The outcome of this workshop is to help the participants familiarize with the unique features and syntax of the Swift Programming Langauge by learning its rather unique approaches to solve design problems such as protocol-oriented, value-oriented, and functional programming. The participants are expected to be ready for the main event on Nov 17th. To make the workshop interactive and engaging, throughout the session, each topic contains a real-life applicable quiz/problem which the participants solve on their own. Shortly after, we will go through the problem together. It will be conducted by [Bob](https://twitter.com/bobleesj) & [me](https://twitter.com/_riteshhh). The following topics just reflect my half of the entire workshop. You can find the [other half i.e. Bob's topics here](https://github.com/bobthedev/try-swift-beginner-workshop-plan).
